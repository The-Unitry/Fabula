# Fabula
A fun way for kids to learn how to calculate.
#### Current version
0.2
## How to run
This game is still in development and it is only possible to run this game using the IntelliJ IDE. We will add support for other platforms later.

## Documentation
#### The UNGameEngine framework
To organize the code, we developed a framework that is used for adding some features to the Swing library. Eventually we want to move away from Swing, but it is currently required by school.
